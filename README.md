Bob the Bird is a winter themed copy of Flappy Bird. It is a simple 2D game where the player controls a bird and tries to get through pipes to earn as many points as possible.

Features

* ### Obstacles:
Pipes spawn continuously at random positions. The player must navigate between these pipes to avoid collisions.
* ### Scoring:
Each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes without colliding, the player earns 1 point.

* ### Particle Effects:
Snowflakes are generated using a particle system to add visual depth to the game.

* ### Start Menu:
When the player launches the game, a start button is displayed. Pressing it switches scenes and begins gameplay.

* ### Endless Gameplay:
Bob the Bird features endless gameplay—there is no final level. The game ends only when the bird collides with a pipe.
